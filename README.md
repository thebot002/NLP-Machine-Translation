I would like to explore developping 3 different techniques to perform Machine Translation. I would like to implement and compare implementations of a Statistical, Rule-Based and Neural Machine Translation. I will attempt to implement these techniques from scratch (not using libraries to do the whole thing) to understand how they work on a deeper level. I plan to implement this in python and to use as dataset sentence correspondances from movies subtitles EN <-> IT coming from opensubtitles.org .
