Title: Exploration of Machine Translation Techniques using Movie Subtitles dataset

Keywords: Machine Translation

Detailed description:
I would like to explore developping 3 different techniques to perform Machine Translation. 
I would like to implement and compare implementations of a Statistical, Rule-Based and Neural Machine Translation.
I will attempt to implement these techniques from scratch (not using libraries to do the whole thing) to understand how they work on a deeper level.
I plan to implement this in python and to use as dataset sentence correspondances from movies subtitles EN <-> IT coming from opensubtitles.org .

Feedback:
If you will develop 3 different techniques, the project will be for sure hard. As a B-plan, you might downgrade to developing 2 techniques only, 
to make sure to stay in about 7 to 10 days of work
